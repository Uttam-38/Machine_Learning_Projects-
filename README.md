# Machine Learning Projects Portfolio

This repository contains a curated collection of **end-to-end Machine Learning and Data Engineering projects** that demonstrate my experience in building **scalable, reproducible, and production-style ML systems**.

The projects emphasize:
- Practical machine learning algorithms
- Data preprocessing and feature engineering
- Model evaluation using appropriate metrics
- Clean software engineering practices
- Real-world datasets and problem statements

Each project is organized as an independent, runnable module with its own documentation and scripts.

## 🚀 Projects

### 🔹 1. Personalized Content Recommendation System
**Folder:** `personalized-recsys/`

A **Netflix-style hybrid recommendation system** that combines:
- Collaborative Filtering (Matrix Factorization using SVD)
- Content-Based Filtering (TF-IDF on movie metadata)
- Hybrid ranking with cold-start handling

**Key Highlights**
- End-to-end ML pipeline (data ingestion → training → evaluation)
- Offline ranking metrics: Precision@K, Recall@K, NDCG@K, MAP@K
- Modular, production-style Python codebase
- Demo script to inspect real recommendations
- Built using MovieLens 1M dataset

➡️ See `personalized-recsys/README.md` for full details.
