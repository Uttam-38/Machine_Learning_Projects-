# Personalized Content Recommendation System (Hybrid)

This project implements a **Netflix-style personalized recommendation system** using a **hybrid approach** that combines **collaborative filtering** and **content-based filtering**, built as a **clean, reproducible, end-to-end machine learning pipeline**.

The system is designed with **software engineering best practices**, modular code structure, and offline evaluation using ranking metrics.

---

## 🔍 Problem Statement

Personalized recommendations are a core component of modern streaming and content platforms.  
The goal of this project is to:

- Recommend relevant content to users based on historical interactions
- Handle cold-start users and items gracefully
- Evaluate recommendation quality using ranking-based metrics
- Build a production-style ML pipeline rather than a single notebook

---

## 🧠 Approach Overview

### 1️⃣ Collaborative Filtering
- Matrix Factorization using **Truncated SVD**
- Learns latent user and item representations from interaction data
- Captures implicit user preferences

### 2️⃣ Content-Based Filtering
- TF-IDF vectorization on **movie titles + genres**
- Computes similarity between items
- Effective for cold-start scenarios

### 3️⃣ Hybrid Recommendation
- Weighted combination of collaborative and content-based scores
- Popularity-based fallback for extreme cold-start users
- Produces robust and interpretable recommendations

---

## 🧪 Evaluation Strategy

The system is evaluated using **offline ranking metrics** on the MovieLens 1M dataset:

- **Precision@K**
- **Recall@K**
- **NDCG@K**
- **MAP@K**

Train/test split is performed **per user**, ensuring each user retains interaction history in training data.

### 📊 Results (MovieLens 1M)

| Metric        | Value   |
|--------------|---------|
| Precision@10 | 0.1596  |
| Recall@10    | 0.0674  |
| NDCG@10      | 0.1936  |
| MAP@10       | 0.1072  |
